# Our-Shopping-List

Our Shopping List is a shopping list designed for being able to shop individually, or for multiple people in order to quickly add / 
remove items as necessary in real time. It provides function in both offline, and online settings where it will sync each list and item 
between all devices that are signed in as that user.

It also provides an ability to scan for items using a barcode, as well as adding items on a barcode with "UPCItemDB" API. As well as 
allowing you to use your phone as a scanner to scan UPC's.

The App uses a NoSQL database, which comes from the real time database as part of Firebase. Firebase also provides the User Creation,
Authentication, support for offline/online usage, and as well as the ability to sync data between devices in real time.
